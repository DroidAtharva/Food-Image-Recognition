# Task 05: Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation

## Description
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize food items from images and estimate their **calorie content**. The goal is to help users track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Food-101
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101)
- The dataset contains 101,000 images of 101 food categories.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - tensorflow
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - sklearn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-recognition.git
   cd food-recognition
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101) and organize it in the `data/` directory.
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python food_recognition.py
   ```
5. View the results, including food recognition and calorie estimation.

## Output
- Classification of food items into categories.
- Estimated calorie content for each food item.
